# Revature Champs Project
Take a review on testing to make sure you are using best practices. Be sure to thoroughly test each method, code coverage means nothing and is simply a metric to ensure some tests have been written. Also, testMethod is deprecated and should not be used. Only declare a test method using the @isTest annotation, as shown in class and in demos.
